% VMs are good but hard to build
% -- even with VM gramworks like Truffle & pypy
% -- makes it hard for a new langauge to get a VM
%
% We are exploring the idea of making a VM for Grace
% -- by adapting VM for NS
%
% Initial results are positive
% -- benchmarks.

In this work, we propose to adapt SOMns ~-- a Newspeak \VM/ tailored to Newspeak ~-- for the Grace programming language. We highlight differences between the semantics of these languages and then offer preliminary results showing that adaption is possible while retaining many of the optimizations offered by the \VM/ framework. Through further experimentation we intend to quantify how the implementation of the tailored \VM/; the flexibility of the host \VM/; and the similarities between the languages affect the potential for adaption.

% So, what I want to know, I guess is, what do we learn here?
