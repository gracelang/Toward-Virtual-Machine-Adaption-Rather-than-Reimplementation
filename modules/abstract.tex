We adapt SOMns, a Truffle-based interpreter for Newspeak, to the Grace programming language. We highlight differences between the semantics of these languages and offer preliminary results showing that adaption is possible while retaining performance. The similarities between the languages promote the potential for adaption and code sharing between implementations. Through experimentation we intend to explore how the design of the tailored implementation; the flexibility of the underlying framework; and similarities between languages affect adaptability, and by doing so hope to realize a set of mechanisms that can be easily extended to create optimized \vms/ for object-orientated languages.
