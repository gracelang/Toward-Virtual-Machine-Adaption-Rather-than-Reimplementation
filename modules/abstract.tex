% Outline
%
% VMs are good but hard to build
% -- even with VM gramworks like Truffle & pypy
% -- makes it hard for a new langauge to get a VM
%
% We are exploring the idea of making a VM for Grace
% -- by adapting VM for NS
%
% Initial results are positive
% -- benchmarks.

While the recent \vmframeworks{} offer the advantages of being able to develop a \vm{} tailored to the needs of a \languageDevs{}, there remains little in the way of extensible components for \translating{} and \visiting{} \irs{} of a language. In this work, we propose to adapt a \vm{} tailored to \Newspeak{} for the \GracePL{}. In order to do so we first highlight differences between the semantics of these languages and then continue to offer preliminary results showing that adaption is possible while retaining the optimizations offered the \vmframework{}.
