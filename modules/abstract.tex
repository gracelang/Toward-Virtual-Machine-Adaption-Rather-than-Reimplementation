% VMs are good but hard to build
% -- even with VM gramworks like Truffle & pypy
% -- makes it hard for a new langauge to get a VM
%
% We are exploring the idea of making a VM for Grace
% -- by adapting VM for NS
%
% Initial results are positive
% -- benchmarks.

In this work, we propose to adapt \SOMns{} -- a \Newspeak{} \vm{} tailored to \Newspeak{} -- for the \GracePL{}. We highlight differences between the semantics of these languages and then offer preliminary results showing that adaption is possible while retaining many of the optimizations offered by the \vmframework{}. Through further experimentation we intend to quantify how the implementation of the \tvm{}; the flexibility of the host \vm{}; and the similarities between involved \pls{} effect the potential for adaption.

% So, what I want to know, I guess is, what do we learn here?
