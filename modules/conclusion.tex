We have presented an experiment in which we realized a ostensible \GraceVM{} from \SOMns{}, while retaining much of the \optimizations{} that were tailored to \Newspeak{}. While further experiments are required before we can quantify the extent to which the similarity of the languages, the craft of \SOMns{}, and the flexibility of \Truffle{} contribute to the ability to make such an adaption. 

While the recent \vmframeworks{} provide significant advantages in terms of being able to develop fully-fledged implementations of a new language, we believe that through the success of further experiments we reconceptualize a small set of reusable tools that \languageDevs{} can extend to build small but valid \tvms{} for their own \noopls{}.
