While the recent \vmframeworks{} provide significant advantages in terms of being able to develop fully-fledged implementations of a new language, there remains novelty in the idea of extending one implementation to another. Through the discourse of adapting \SOMns{} into \GraceVM{}, we ultimately hope to conceptualize a small set of tools reusable tools that \languageDevs{} can extend to build small but valid \tvms{} for their own \noopls{}.
