\Newspeak{} was a significant influence on \Grace{}'s design. \Grace{} shares with \Newspeak{} that static types generally do not affect a program's execution; that control structures are handled with lambda expressions; and (to an extent) that class definitions can be nested. The most significant underlying difference in \Grace{} is that classes are defined in terms of objects and their definitions can be nested freely (inside other objects, classes, methods, or lambda expressions), whereas in \Newspeak{} objects are defined in terms of classes and classes can only be declared nested inside other classes.

%  Notes

% Additionally, the rise of dynamic languages has led to a plethora of new VMs, since a completely new VM is typically developed for every new language. VMs are still mostly monolithic pieces of software. They are developed in C or C++, the languages that they aim to replace. In summary, VMs offer a lot of benefits for applications running on top of them, but they mostly do not utilize these benefits for themselves.
% -- \rcite{Wimmer2012}{203}

% The goal of our research is to investigate the impact of fine-grained modularity on VMs. We envision a VM following the “everything is extensible” paradigm, by combining best practices of existing VM design and existing module systems.
