    \mwh{It would be good to say which functionalies are supported so far, and how those were selected (because they matched what SOMns already does? because they matched existing Grace benchmarks?). That may affect how any metric results should be interpreted.}

% Thus, we modified SOMns to use our translator. When called, the translator first parses Grace's prelude and then continues to the input program. Once an \AST/ has been formed, the translator composes the program representation based on SOMns's Truffle nodes.

% Reusing an existing Grace parser, we translate Grace's \AST/ nodes into those used by SOMns to have a basic Grace \vm/,


\rr{Due to the similarities of the languages, it is possible execute Grace programs using SOMns with little more than a specialized AST visitor that translates Grace's nodes into those that can be executed directly by SOMns; in a few cases it composes together multiple nodes to preserve semantics. As illustrated in \autoref{fig:components}, the translator is all the is needed for the adaption (we reuse an existing Grace parser).} For the initial proof of concept, we have implemented expression nodes, numerals and string nodes, as well as nodes to maintain lexical scoping for blocks and methods.

% The JIT times do.    the non-JIT times do not.
% ievel 81s vs 12s /   0.9 vs 0.8

% we are having the benefit of the Truffle JIT + existing SOMns optimisations
% that mean jitted we are roughly comparable to SOMns but non-kjitted we are 10 times slower.


% Despite being tailored to Newspeak, SOMns can be easily adapted to Grace through our translator.

To date SOMns has been under development for $22$ months, and is as fast as other \JITing/ \vms/. In contrast Grace has been in development for around five years, without consideration of performance thus far. Yet, in only three weeks, we have adapted a Truffle-based \vm/ to realize a new implementation that supports Grace's primitive operations; compound expressions; method and field declarations, and object instantiation. We do not yet support full inheritance nor type systems.

Our implementation adheres correctly to the expected semantics and Grace programs can be executed with comparable speed to Newspeak. As indicated by the benchmarks in \autoref{fig:benchmark}, the loss of performance due to the additional translation step is marginal. The implementation retains much of the optimizations that were carefully tailored for Newspeak but required only a trivial amount of work by comparison.

% We have presented an experiment in which we realized a \vm/ for Grace from SOMns, while retaining much of the \AST/ optimizations. While further experiments are required before we can quantify the extent to which the similarity of the languages, the craft of SOMns, and the flexibility of Truffle contribute to the ability to make such an adaption.\mwh{While further experiments are required, what?}
