    \mwh{It would be good to say which functionalies are supported so far, and how those were selected (because they matched what SOMns already does? because they matched existing Grace benchmarks?). That may affect how any metric results should be interpreted.}

% Thus, we modified SOMns to use our translator. When called, the translator first parses Grace's prelude and then continues to the input program. Once an \AST/ has been formed, the translator composes the program representation based on SOMns's Truffle nodes.

% Reusing an existing Grace parser, we translate Grace's \AST/ nodes into those used by SOMns to have a basic Grace \vm/,


The translator is little more than an AST visitor that reads the nodes in one form and exports them in other; and in a few cases it composes together multiple nodes to preserve Grace's semantics. We reuse an existing an Grace parser and translate the resulting nodes into a valid SOMns \AST/, refer to \autoref{fig:components}. For the initial proof of concept, we have implemented expression nodes, numerals and string nodes, as well as nodes to maintain lexical scoping for blocks and methods.

% Despite being tailored to Newspeak, SOMns can be easily adapted to Grace through our translator.

To date SOMns has been under development for $22$ months: it is mostly compliant with Newspeak, and is as fast as other \JITing/ \vms/. In contrast Grace has been in development for around five years, without consideration of performance. Yet, in only three weeks, we have adapted a Truffle-based \vm/ to realize a new implementation that supports Grace's primitive operations; compound expressions; method and field declarations, and object instantiation. We do not yet support full inheritance nor type systems.

Our implementation adheres correctly to the expected semantics and Grace programs can be executed with comparable speed to Newspeak. As indicated by the benchmarks in \autoref{fig:benchmark}, there is only a marginal loss of performance due to the additional translation step. In conclusion, the implementation retains much of the optimizations carefully tailored for Newspeak and required only a relatively small amount of work.

% We have presented an experiment in which we realized a \vm/ for Grace from SOMns, while retaining much of the \AST/ optimizations. While further experiments are required before we can quantify the extent to which the similarity of the languages, the craft of SOMns, and the flexibility of Truffle contribute to the ability to make such an adaption.\mwh{While further experiments are required, what?}
