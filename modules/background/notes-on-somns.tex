While there are number of \Newspeak{} implementations, we are interested in \SOMns{} \rcite{stefanEventLoop}, a high-performance \vm{} based on \Truffle{} and the \Graal{} compiler \rcite{Wurthinger:2013:OVR}.
\SOMns{} is a \emph{mostly} compliant implementation of the \Newspeak{} specification.\footnote{\url{http://newspeaklanguage.org/spec/newspeak-spec.pdf}} Compared to Newspeak, it forgoes support for image-based development, many
reflective features, and a foreign function interface. Instead, it is meant as
a research platform for investigating concurrency models.
