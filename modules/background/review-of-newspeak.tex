\Newspeak{} is an object-oriented language designed to combine the benefits of \Smalltalk{}'s deeply nested class definitions with support libraries and family polymorphism (as in \BETA{} and \gBETA{}) \rcite{Bracha2010,Madsen1993,Ernst2001}. Like \Smalltalk{}, \Newspeak{} is a pure object-oriented language, in that all computation proceeds via messages sent to objects. Additionally, \Newspeak{} adopts \Smalltalk{}'s multi-part message syntax and use of lambda-expressions (``blocks'') to encode control structures.
