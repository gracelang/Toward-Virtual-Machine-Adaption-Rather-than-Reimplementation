\Grace{} is a new \oopl{} ostensibly designed to support education \rcite{Black2012}. \Grace{}'s syntax is designed to look similar to \Java{} (or more generally, the ``curly bracket'' languages) but draws widely on the traditions of \oop{}. \Grace{} is designed to mix static and dynamic types (like \Strongtalk{} or C$\sharp$); makes heavy use of lambda expresions (like \Smalltalk{} or \Ruby{}); supports nested class definitions (like \BETA{}); and uses method aliasing for inheritance (somewhat like \Eiffel{}).
