### James

What were you suggesting by `\cite{stefanEventLoop,Truffle,Graal}`? 
  
- Do you mean that I should just one or two papers on Truffle and Graal,
- and then ask Stefan what stefanEventLoop is?

<br>

### Stefan

- Would you mind adding a sentence or two on *SOMns* at the end of the background section?
- Refer to `modules/background/notes-on-somns.tex`

<br>

### Other

- Are there any acknowledgements?
