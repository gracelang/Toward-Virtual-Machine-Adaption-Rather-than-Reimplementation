## Abstract

In this work, we adapt SOMns, a Truffle-based interpreter for Newspeak, to the Grace programming language. We highlight differences between the semantics of these languages and offer preliminary results showing that adaption is possible while retaining SOMnsâ€™ performance, which is competitive with state-of-the-art custom-built virtual machines. Through further experimentation, we intend to quantify how the implementation of the tailored virtual machine; the flexibility of the host virtual machine; and the similarities between the languages affect the potential for adaption and code sharing between language implementations.
